Suppose your personal website is hosted in a Github page as follows:

https://username.github.io
The repository should be name as username.github.io. If you have a pdf file named document.pdf and you place it in the directory folder then you should be able to open it directly in the browser through the following link:

https://username.github.io/folder/document.pdf
To allow the user to open the pdf in a new window in the browser, you may use the following HTML, where "PDF" points to the link:

<a href="username.github.io/folder/document.pdf" target="_blank">PDF.</a>

Then I get a link that opens to new tab instead of a pdf embedded page. However, I have saved to pdf to image, and was able to display that in the page.
